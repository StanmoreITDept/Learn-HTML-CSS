# Introduction to HTML
##  HTML (HyperText Markup Language) â€” the backbone of every website.

## What is HTML?
HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It is the **standard markup language** used to create and structure pages on the web.

With HTML, you can:

- Structure text and images on a webpage

- Create links between pages

- Embed multimedia (like videos and audio)

- Build forms for user input

- Add semantic meaning to content

## Why learn HTML?  
HTML is the **foundation of web development**. Every webpage you visit is built using HTML in some form. Learning HTML helps you:

- Understand how websites work

- Create your own webpages

- Work with CSS and JavaScript effectively

- Build strong fundamentals for front-end development

## HTML building blocks?

| **Elements**      | The building blocks of HTML (e.g., `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<img>`)                 |
| **Tags**          | Markups that tell the browser how to display content                       |
| **Attributes**    | Provide additional information about elements (e.g., `src`, `alt`, `href`) |
| **Nesting**       | Placing elements inside other elements                                     |

## Example of a simple HTML Document

```html 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Page!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

- The `<html>` element is the root element of an HTML page
- The `<head>` element contains meta information about the HTML page
- The `<title>` element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
- The `<body>` element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
- The `<h1>` element defines a large heading
